# NaPoGenMo-2017
[National Poetry Generation Month 2017](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017)

My [declaration of intention to participate](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017/issues/4).

My [2016](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/NaPoGenMo2016/) repo ("PoeticalBot"), that has continued to be added to. I expect that whatever I do this year will be appended to that.


# NOTES
 - Allison Parish's [L-systems poetry](https://github.com/aparrish/linear-lsystem-poetry)
  - I think this could be smooshed into an `npm` module
  - right now it's hard-coded for an web-interface

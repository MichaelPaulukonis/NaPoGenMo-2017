# NaPoGenMo-2017
[National Poetry Generation Month 2017](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017)

My [declaration of intention to participate](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2017/issues/4).

My [2016](https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/NaPoGenMo2016/) repo ("PoeticalBot"), that has continued to be added to. I expect that whatever I do this year will be appended to that.
